        <h1>Hi! I'm Brandon.</h1>
        <p>
          I am a M.S student in Computer Science at Texas State University. My
          thesis will be on adaptive synthesis of compression algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          My academic interests include parallel computing, web development, and
          game development. After hours you'll find me playing [video
          games](https://www.backloggd.com/u/duke_of_jukes/), watching
          [movies](https://letterboxd.com/duke_of_jukes/), and making food and
          drinks.
