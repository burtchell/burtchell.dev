# hello.

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Texas State University. My current research is on adaptive synthesis of compression algorithms, working with [Martin Burtscher](https://userweb.cs.txstate.edu/~burtscher/) at the
[Efficient Computing Lab](https://userweb.cs.txstate.edu/~burtscher/research.html).

My academic interests include parallel computing, web development, and game development. After hours you'll find me playing [video games](https://www.backloggd.com/u/duke_of_jukes/), watching [movies](https://letterboxd.com/duke_of_jukes/), and making food and drink.
