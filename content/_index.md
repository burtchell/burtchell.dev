# howdy!

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Texas State University. I'm currently working with [Martin Burtscher](https://userweb.cs.txstate.edu/~burtscher/) at the
[Efficient Computing Lab](https://userweb.cs.txstate.edu/~burtscher/research.html).

My research interests include parallel computing and data compression. After hours, you'll find me watching [movies](https://letterboxd.com/duke_of_jukes/), playing [video games](https://www.backloggd.com/u/duke_of_jukes/), and making food and drink.
